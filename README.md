# MakersBnB
Utilising aesthetics that could be loosely associated with styling, MakersBnB is an AirBnB bootleg of a most endearingly mediocre standard. It was constructed in 4 days in a team of 4 and is therefore slightly unfinished but, as a first group project,  we're still proud of it anyway! 
FAQs:
> Will improvements be made in the future?
> Won't beat around the bush and go for a solid maybe.

> How much can I buy this for?
> That's a great question, a fiver and or a small dog should do it.

## Booting up this fragile Sinatra App
Without further ado, lets set up a local server and get this questionable app running on your machine.
From here on out there is an assumption that you're familiar with interacting with the terminal, git and have ruby installed on your machine. Sorry that this isn't of more use, but we haven't actually been using these tools for too long and aren't 100% sure what's going on ourselves. If you're not bothered, then don't worry, you're not really missing out on too much! 

### 1) Clone this repository

```
 cd /wherever/you/want/to/clone/this/repo
 git clone https://github.com/whatsrupp/makers-bnb
```

### 2) Install basic requirements
Firstly install bundler, this will make installing everything else a dream
```
gem intall bundler
```
then cd to the main directory of makers-bnb
```
cd to/the/location/of/makers-bnb
```
run bundler
```
bundle install 
```
your machine should now have all the required packages to kick things off.
### 3) Boot the server
Launch the server using the rackup gem
```
rackup
```
you should then see a server log that looks something like the below:
```
[2017-04-29 23:50:14] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2017-04-29 23:50:14] INFO  ruby 2.4.0 (2016-12-24) [x86_64-darwin16]
[2017-04-29 23:50:14] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=18767 port=9292
```
the listed port (in this case 9292) is the port you need to access in your browser. 
Open up the browser and enter the following into your URL.
```
localhost:9292
```
### 4) Enjoy!
Sign up and have a play! Just a heads up, the styling gets progressively worse the further you get through the file roots, it's one of our USPs.

## Packages Used
Shout out to the main gems in our lives for the last week 
bcrypt - keeping those passwords deliciously salted
capybara - allows us to run tests in a headless browser 
sinatra - good singer, better web-app manager
data-mapper - handles talking to the servers so you don't have to
database cleaner - clears out swathes of rubbish in your server generated by your tests
rack - 'rack up' those servers 
pry - probably shouldn't still be in the dependancies but it saved us on the debugging
rspec - keeping it all TDD since day 1
